// In the context of the first set of 3 fork() calls, we observe the emergence of 8 processes. This outcome aligns with the 2^n principle, where 'n' signifies the number of fork() calls. In this case, it's 3, resulting in 2^3, which equals 8. Visualized as a binomial progression: 1 - 3 - 3 - 1, these values sum up to 8. The initial fork() call generates 3 child processes, while subsequent calls produce either 1 or 2 child processes.

// On the other hand, during the second round of 5 fork() calls, we encounter a different scenario, yielding 32 processes. This outcome adheres to the 2^n rule, where 'n' now stands at 5, resulting in 2^5, which equals 32. Represented as a binomial sequence: 1 - 5 - 10 - 10 - 5 - 1, the sum of these figures also amounts to 32. Here, the first fork() call gives rise to 5 child processes.

// The noteworthy contrast between these results arises from the varying count of fork() calls in each execution, showcasing non-linear behavior dictated by the 2^n formula.
