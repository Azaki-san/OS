Unnamed pipes allow only one-way communication from a publisher to a subscriber using stdin/stdout.
Named pipes provide bidirectional communication between processes. 
So, for each subscriber we have named pipe for receving message(s).
Publisher just write messages to pipes of subscribers.
This exercise demonstrated inter-process communication through pipes and named pipes, essential for multi-process applications.
