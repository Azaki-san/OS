Exercise 4 uses a global state approach with mutexes.
It may have more efficient resource utilization and reduced thread overhead, potentially making it more suitable for certain scenarios.
Mutexes are used to prevent shared variable race conditions.
As we can see from results, mutexes sometimes faster, but in dividing, for example, by 100 threads - slower.
So, it depends.
