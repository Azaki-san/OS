First Fit: Throughput of 143.59 queries/second
Best Fit: Throughput of 41.38 queries/second
Worst Fit: Throughput of 40.49 queries/second
In this scenario, "First Fit" is the most efficient algorithm in terms of throughput. It's important to note that the performance of these algorithms can vary based on the specific workload and input data. In this particular case, "First Fit" is the best choice for this workload. However, it's recommended to conduct further analysis and testing with different workloads to choose the most suitable allocation algorithm for a given application.
It was tested a several times and the first fit algorithm in 10 of 10 variants have best results on the provided test.
