Throughout our observation, the program consistently allocates approximately ~11,500 KB of memory due to its routine allocation of 10 MB during each iteration, resulting in minimal memory fluctuations. The 'si' and 'so' fields in the vmstat output remain at 0, indicating a lack of swapping between physical memory and the swap space. This is typical when the system has ample available memory. CPU usage conforms to expected patterns, with a high idle time (id) reflecting an idle CPU, user processes (us) utilizing the CPU, and a minor involvement of system processes (sy). These findings suggest that the program's memory allocation doesn't significantly perturb the system's memory management, and the CPU operates within customary usage parameters.
