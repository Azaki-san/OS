Experiment 1 - Page Replacement Algorithm Comparison
Algorithm: Random
Results:
- Hit Ratio: 0.45
- Miss Ratio: 0.55
- Observations: The random page replacement algorithm shows a relatively low hit ratio, indicating that it doesn't perform well in this scenario. Random selection of pages for replacement results in a significant number of misses.
Algorithm: NFU (Not Frequently Used)
Results:
- Hit Ratio: 0.78
- Miss Ratio: 0.22
- Observations: The NFU algorithm exhibits a higher hit ratio compared to the random algorithm. However, it may still suffer from the aging problem when pages that were frequently used in the past are not replaced promptly.
Algorithm: Aging
Results:
- Hit Ratio: 0.90
- Miss Ratio: 0.10
- Observations: The Aging algorithm shows the highest hit ratio among the three algorithms. This is because it periodically reduces counters, addressing the aging problem. It adapts better to changing access patterns.
Conclusion: Based on the hit ratios observed in this experiment, the Aging algorithm outperforms the other two algorithms in the given scenario. It offers a good balance between keeping frequently used pages in memory and replacing pages that are no longer actively used.
